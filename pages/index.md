The Linux User Group at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu)
(CNULUG) is a community for people who use Linux or 
who are interested in learning about it.

We are dedicated to promoting smart and socially aware computer usage.
This is done using the following [core goals for
LUGs](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO-4.html):

- advocacy
- education
- support
- socializing

We welcome new users and do not charge dues or discriminate about level of
skill.

## Goals

CNULUG exists as a general advocate of Linux and open-source software.
We have some important goals related to CNU, however:

- Help Linux and free/open-source software (FOSS) users access standard 
  university resources
- Improve on-campus knowledge and support for Linux/FOSS
- Educate users on modern uses of Linux, including security, web development 
  and computer engineering for ARM architectures
- Establish CNU a meaningful presence in the open-source world

If these sound like good ideas to you, please
[join our mailing list](/mail.html)
to get involved.
