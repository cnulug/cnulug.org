The Linux User Group at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu)
is a community for people who use Linux or are interested in learning about it.

We are dedicated to promoting smart and socially aware computer usage.
This is done using the following [core goals for
LUGs](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO-4.html):

- advocacy
- education
- support
- socializing

We welcome new users and do not charge dues or discriminate about level of
skill.
